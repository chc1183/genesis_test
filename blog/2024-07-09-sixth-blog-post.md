# Migrating from Wordpress

It's been almost one week since I decided to move away from WordPress and onto a static site generator. I started my journey with Docusaurus and then stumbled upon [MkDocs](https://genesistechwriter.netlify.app/). I'm still unsure which generator I'll actually stick with, as I still have much to learn before making that decision. I do like that MkDocs supports [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/).

All I know is that both Docusaurus and MkDocs are much better than WordPress ðŸ¤­ (for my portfolio, I meanâ€”no disrespect to WordPress ðŸ˜¬).
