Today, I spent some time learning about [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), another static site generator. I coupled it with the incredible [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) framework and, bam, I've created another version of my portfolio. Check it out over here. Just like this website, I used Netlify to deploy my builds.
